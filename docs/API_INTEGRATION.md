# API Integration Documentation

## Telebirr Payment Integration

### Overview
Telebirr is a mobile money service in Ethiopia that allows users to make digital payments. Our app integrates with Telebirr to provide a seamless payment experience for customers booking truck services.

### Integration Flow
1. **Payment Initiation**: When a customer confirms a booking and selects Telebirr as the payment method, the app initiates a payment request to the Telebirr API.
2. **Payment Processing**: The customer is redirected to the Telebirr app or web interface to authorize the payment.
3. **Payment Verification**: After the customer completes the payment, the app verifies the transaction status with the Telebirr API.
4. **Order Confirmation**: Upon successful verification, the app confirms the booking and proceeds to the tracking screen.

### API Endpoints

#### Initiate Payment
```typescript
interface TelebirrPaymentParams {
  amount: number;
  referenceId: string;
  subject?: string;
  customerName?: string;
  customerPhone?: string;
}

const initiateTelebirrPayment = async (
  params: TelebirrPaymentParams
): Promise<TelebirrResponse> => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

#### Verify Payment
```typescript
const verifyTelebirrPayment = async (
  outTradeNo: string
): Promise<TelebirrResponse> => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

### Error Handling
The integration includes comprehensive error handling for scenarios such as:
- Network failures
- Payment cancellations
- Timeout issues
- Verification failures

### Testing
For testing purposes, the integration includes a mock implementation that simulates the Telebirr API behavior without making actual API calls.

## GeezSMS OTP Verification

### Overview
GeezSMS is an SMS gateway service in Ethiopia that allows sending text messages programmatically. Our app uses GeezSMS to send one-time passwords (OTP) for phone number verification during the registration and login process.

### Integration Flow
1. **OTP Request**: When a user enters their phone number, the app requests an OTP from the GeezSMS API.
2. **OTP Delivery**: GeezSMS sends an SMS containing the OTP to the user's phone number.
3. **OTP Verification**: The user enters the OTP in the app, which verifies it against the expected value.
4. **Authentication**: Upon successful verification, the user is authenticated and proceeds to the next screen.

### API Endpoints

#### Send OTP
```typescript
interface SendOTPParams {
  phoneNumber: string;
  messageTemplate?: string;
}

const sendOTP = async (
  params: SendOTPParams
): Promise<OTPResponse> => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

#### Verify OTP
```typescript
interface VerifyOTPParams {
  phoneNumber: string;
  otpCode: string;
}

const verifyOTP = async (
  params: VerifyOTPParams
): Promise<VerificationResponse> => {
  // Implementation details
};
```

### Error Handling
The integration includes error handling for scenarios such as:
- Invalid phone numbers
- Failed SMS delivery
- Incorrect OTP entries
- Expired OTPs

### Testing
For testing purposes, the integration includes a mock implementation that bypasses actual SMS sending and allows using predefined OTP codes.

## Maps Integration

### Overview
The app integrates with maps services to provide location selection, route visualization, and real-time tracking features.

### Key Features
- Address autocomplete for location selection
- Route calculation between pickup and destination
- Real-time driver location tracking
- Estimated time of arrival calculation

### Implementation Details
The maps integration is implemented using React Native components and third-party mapping libraries, with custom styling to match the app's design language.

## Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
All API communications are encrypted using HTTPS/TLS to protect sensitive information during transmission.

### API Authentication
API requests include appropriate authentication headers to ensure that only authorized requests are processed.

### Sensitive Data Handling
Sensitive data such as payment information and user credentials are handled according to best practices and are not stored locally unless necessary.

### Rate Limiting
Implementations include rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse of the API services.

## Fallback Mechanisms

### Offline Mode
The app includes fallback mechanisms for scenarios where API services are unavailable, allowing users to continue using critical features.

### Alternative Payment Methods
In case of Telebirr service disruptions, the app offers alternative payment methods such as cash on delivery.

### SMS Fallback
If OTP delivery via GeezSMS fails, the app provides alternative verification methods or retry options.
