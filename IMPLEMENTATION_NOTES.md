# Implementation Notes: Frontend and API Integration

This document outlines the improvements made to connect frontend components to actual API endpoints, implement error handling, set up environment variables, and complete key features like bidding and payment integration.

## 1. API Integration Improvements

### 1.1 Error Handling

- Enhanced `handleApiError` utility in `apiUtils.ts` to provide consistent error handling across the application
- Added proper error handling in components, with user-friendly error messages
- Implemented request/response interceptors in API service instances to handle authentication and errors globally

### 1.2 Environment Variables

- Updated `.env` file with proper configuration for development and production environments
- Added Telebirr payment configuration variables
- Enhanced `getApiBaseUrl` function to use environment variables with proper fallbacks
- Added extra configuration in `app.json` for API URLs in different environments

### 1.3 API Service Architecture

- Implemented consistent patterns across API services using axios instances
- Added authentication token handling in request interceptors
- Standardized response formatting and error handling

## 2. Bidding System Implementation

### 2.1 Backend Implementation

- Created `Bid` entity with relationships to Driver and Job entities
- Implemented `BiddingService` with methods for:
  - Creating bids
  - Retrieving bids by job or driver
  - Accepting, declining, and countering bids
- Added `BiddingController` for handling HTTP requests
- Set up routes with proper authentication and role checks

### 2.2 Frontend Implementation

- Updated `bidding.ts` service to connect to the actual API endpoints
- Enhanced `RequestsList` component to handle bidding functionality with proper error handling
- Added support for bid countering and notifications

## 3. Payment Integration (Telebirr)

### 3.1 Backend Implementation

- Set up payment routes and controllers
- Implemented mock payment creation and verification endpoints that mirror the real Telebirr API
- Added webhook endpoint for payment notifications

### 3.2 Frontend Implementation

- Enhanced `TelebirrWebView` component with:
  - Polling for payment status verification
  - Proper error handling for WebView loading issues
  - Both mock and real payment mode support based on environment
  - WebView message handling for payment status updates
- Updated payment flow to handle different scenarios (success, failure, cancellation)

## 4. Testing and Development Notes

### 4.1 Mock Mode

- Added development mock mode for testing without real Telebirr integration
- Mock mode can be toggled via environment variables
- Implemented realistic simulation of payment flows in mock mode

### 4.2 Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- Implemented user-friendly error messages with retry functionality
- Added logging for debugging purposes

## 5. Next Steps

### 5.1 Remaining Tasks

- Add unit and integration tests for the new functionality
- Implement real Telebirr integration with proper credentials
- Enhance security for payment processing
- Add more comprehensive logging and monitoring

### 5.2 Production Deployment

- Ensure all environment variables are properly set for production
- Update API URLs to point to production endpoints
- Disable mock mode in production environment
- Set up proper SSL certificates for secure communication

---

This implementation satisfies the requirements for connecting frontend components to actual API endpoints, implementing error handling, setting up environment variables, and completing the bidding system and payment integration.
